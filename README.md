## 🌌 What is SAT?

SAT is not a sleep tracker. It is not a meditation app. It is a **Panic Interrupter**.

Designed specifically for the moment you wake up at 2 AM with a racing heart, SAT uses cognitive science to hijack your brain's "fight or flight" response and gently steer it back to safety.

**Offline-Ready. Privacy-First. Zero Tracking.**

## ✨ Advanced Sleep Engineering

### 🔥 The Worry Burner
Externalize your anxiety. Type out the thought that is haunting you, and watch it visually burn away into ash particles. A powerful psychological release mechanism.

### 🌑 Hypnotic Canvas
Drift away with our generative "Deep Sea" background. Slow, mathematical particle movements designed to induce visual trance and lower brainwave frequency.

### 🫁 Interactive Breathwork
*   **Box Breathing (4-4-4-4):** The Navy SEAL technique for immediate panic reduction.
*   **4-7-8 Breathing:** A natural nervous system tranquilizer that acts like a sedative.

### 🕯️ Candle Mediation
A 3D-simulated candle flame that responds to your presence. Focus on the flicker to narrow your attention and ground yourself in the present.

### 🔊 Generative Soundscapes
Bypass silence with our expanded audio engine:
*   **Brown Noise:** Deep, rumble-frequency noise to mask thoughts.
*   **Heavy Rain:** Consistent, high-fidelity nature loops.
*   **Crackling Fire:** Warm, primal comfort sound.
*   **Thunder:** Distant rolling storms for cozy safety.

## 📱 Mobile & PWA
SAT is a fully optimized **Progressive Web App**. It feels native on every device.

*   **iOS/Android Optimized:** Full support for notches, safe areas, and touch gestures.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle vibrations ground you physically in reality.
*   **Fade to Black:** If you drift off, the screen automatically dims to 10% brightness after 5 minutes to protect your sleep.
*   **Offline First:** Works perfectly without an internet connection.
