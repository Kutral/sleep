    <article id="box-breathing">
        <h2>The Science of Box Breathing</h2>
        <p>Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a powerful stress-reduction technique used by everyone from
            athletes to Navy SEALs. It is a form of paced breathing that involves inhaling, holding, exhaling, and
            holding again for equal durations (typically 4 seconds).</p>

        <h3>Why It Works</h3>
        <p>Anxiety and panic attacks often trigger hyperventilation or shallow, rapid breathing. This signals the brain
            that the body is in danger, activating the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight). Box breathing
            interrupts this feedback loop.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> By forcefully regulating your breath rhythm, you stimulate the vagus
                nerve. This activation signals your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) to take over,
                effectively lowering heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How to Practice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inhale</strong> slowly through your nose for 4 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Hold</strong> your breath for 4 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Exhale</strong> completely through your mouth for 4 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Hold</strong> your empty lungs for 4 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Repeat this cycle for at least 4 rounds to feel a physiological shift.</p>

        <h2>Cognitive Shuffling (Serial Diverse Imagining)</h2>
        <p>When you can't sleep, your brain is often trapped in "cognitive arousal"—obsessively planning, analyzing, or
            worrying. This hyper-focused state is the enemy of sleep.</p>

        <h3>The Theory</h3>
        <p>Cognitive Shuffling was developed by cognitive scientist Dr. Luc Beaudoin. The theory posits that the brain
            has a "sleep onset control system" that checks if it's safe to sleep. If you are focused on logical,
            coherent thoughts (like tomorrow's meeting), the brain assumes you are in "problem-solving mode" and keeps
            you awake.</p>

        <p>To trick the brain into sleep, you need to mimic the fragmented, non-sensical nature of dreams (hypnagogic
            imagery).</p>

        <h3>The Technique</h3>
        <p>The method involves visualizing a sequence of random, unrelated objects (e.g., "toaster," "mountain,"
            "zebra"). This process scrambles your brain's logical centers, preventing coherent worry loops and signaling
            to the brain that it is safe to drift off.</p>

        <h2>The Psychology of "Letting Go"</h2>
        <p>Writing down worries is a well-established cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) technique. The "Worry Burner"
            feature in SAT takes this a step further by adding a symbolic act of destruction.</p>

        <p>Research suggests that externalizing a thought—getting it out of your head and onto a screen or paper—reduces
            its cognitive load. It frees up "working memory" that was previously occupied by maintaining the worry.</p>

        <p>By visually "burning" the text, we provide a sense of closure and finality, reinforcing the decision to let
            go of the thought for the night.</p>
